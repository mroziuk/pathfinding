## app allows you to visualise pathfinding algorithms
1. Bredth first search
2. Depth first search
3. Dijkstra algorithm
4. A* algorithm

## instructions
- to begin select algorithm from right panel. You can choose to see ```next step``` or all steps at once (```run```).
- click ```show path``` to see shortest (or not) path. bfs, dfs and dijkstra show just the information if the node was visited or not. A* shows also values of g and h [(see more)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Description).
- You can draw walls by clicking or draging mouse, delete walls by clicking on existing wall tiles and draging the mouse.
- Move start or end node by draging them.

app saves state of the program, you can close and come back to same settings as before.
